# Risk: Legacy
A companion tool by Catheraaine


## This project serves two purposes, and neither of them are profit.

Broadly, it is to create a tracker for remote play of the game [Risk: Legacy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/105134/risk-legacy), a serial board game where every action you take has a chance to permanently effect the game. Rip cards, write things in permanent marker, and ruin friendships forever (it is _Risk_, after all).

The first reason I've chosen this game to create is, well, that I'm playing it. With a group of friends. One of whom decided to move 500 miles away to work on a naval base. We started playing the game by webcam, but there is a LOT of information to share, and that kind of interface isn't ideal.

Which leads to the second reason. Right around this time, I started [an apprenticeship](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/why_we_apprentice) at [Sparkbox](https://seesparkbox.com/). One day during _Risk_ it hit me -- hey! I'm a developer, sort of. I can fix this! I thought it would be a great tool to apply what I was learning, get more practice, and just become an overall better developer.

I've fleshed out a huge portion of the UI myself, including a hoverable, color-changing SVG of the map. However, I am missing one huge component: *The game doesn't yet work*. I've since started developing full time ( woo! ), and have cast this aside as a free time project that is a bit too huge for the amount of time I have free. Thus, here it is, an open source project for nothing beyond a _friendly_ game of _Risk_.

Help me GitHub-Kenobi, you're my only hope.

## The road from here.

Goal: Make It Work.

Sure, my UI is lovely, but I have a form that's not hooked into anything and no way to save information between sessions. There is no framework, no tests, and massive inline SVGs. I'm not even sure I know what I need, so feel free to submit issues if you think something is missing, broken, or done like someone two months into her code apprenticeship.

[The rules of the game are available on Hasbro's site](http://www.hasbro.com/common/documents/dad2886d1c4311ddbd0b0800200c9a66/00D721465056900B10A16E11F8F54E7F.pdf), that's a good place to begin.

## Quick Start
:information_source: These steps require a recent version of `node-js` and `npm`. Right now they are used to compile SASS, so you could do this build step manually if you prefer.

 1. Clone this repo locally.
 2. Run `npm install` local to the repository root. This will install build dependencies.
 3. Run `npm run build` to perform build tasks.
 4. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Final Notes
  - You can [view an online version of this code on my personal website](http://catheraaine.com/risk-legacy/index.html). I'll try to update that, and I'll be learning along the way.

  - This is an educational tool, not for profit, and 100% for personal use. Think of it as super high tech note cards. Please, don't sue me!

  - If you'd like to learn more about code, or know someone who would, why not apply to [Sparkbox's Apprenticeship program](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/apply_for_sparkboxs_2017_dev_apprenticeship)? Applications are typically due at the end of October. It could change your life. It did mine.
